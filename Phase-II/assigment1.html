    <p>Kedarnath Temple (Sanskrit: केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST: Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit. 'temple of the God of the field') is
        a Hindu temple, one of the twelve jyotirlinga of Shiva. The temple is located on the Garhwal Himalayan range[1]
        near the Mandakini river, in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is
        open to the general public only between the months of April (Akshaya Tritiya) and November (Kartik Purnima, the
        autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigraha (deity) of the temple is carried down to Ukhimath to be
        worshipped for the next six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogeneous form of Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand',
        the historical name of the region. <br>
        <br>
        The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 22 kilometres (14 mi) uphill trek from
        Gaurikund. Pony, mule and manchan service is available to reach the temple. According to Hindu legends, the
        temple was initially built by the Pandavas, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest Hindu shrines of
        Shiva.[1] The Pandavas were supposed to have pleased Shiva by doing penance in Kedarnath.[1][3] The temple is
        one of the four major sites in India's Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas and is the first of the
        Panch Kedar pilgrimage sites. This temple is the highest among the 12 Jyotirlingas.[4] It is one of the 275
        paadal petra sthalams expounded in the Tevaram, a sacred Tamil Shaivite text written during the 6th and 7th
        centuries by 63 saints called Nayanars. This temple is sung of by Thirugnanasambandar, Appar, Sundarar and
        Sekkizhar in their Tevaram texts.[5] <br>
        <br>
        Kedarnath was the worst affected area during the 2013 flash floods in North India. The temple complex,
        surrounding areas, and Kedarnath town suffered extensive damage, but the temple structure did not suffer any
        major damage, apart from a few cracks on one side of the four walls which was caused by the flowing debris from
        the higher mountains. A large rock among the debris acted as a barrier, protecting the temple from the flood.
        The surrounding premises and other buildings in the market area were heavily damaged.

        History and legends of origin:
        <div>

        The Pandavas visit Kedarnath after the Mahabharata War
        At a height of 3,583 m (11,755 ft), 223 km (139 mi) from Rishikesh, on the shores of Mandakini river, a
        tributary of Ganga, is a stone edifice of unknown date.[7] It is not certain who built the original Kedarnath
        temple and when. The name "Kedarnath" means "the lord of the field": it derives from the Sanskrit words kedara
        ("field") and natha ("lord"). The text Kashi Kedara Mahatmya states that it is so called because "the crop of
        liberation" grows here.[8]
    </div>
        A folk legend about Kedarnath relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Pandavas
        wanted to atone for the sins committed during the Kurukshetra war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their
        kingdom to their kin and left in search of the lord Shiva and to seek his blessings. But, Shiva wanted to avoid
        them and assumed the form of a bull (Nandi). Bhima, the second of the five Pandava brothers, then saw the bull
        grazing near Guptakashi ("hidden Kashi" — the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima immediately
        recognized the bull to be Shiva.
        <br> Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull-formed
        Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms
        appearing in Tungnath, the face showing up at Rudranath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in
        Madhyamaheshwar and the hair appearing in Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five
        different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping Shiva. These five places are
        collectively known as Panch kedar.<br>
<br>
        A variant of the tale credits Bhima for not only catching the bull but also stopping it from disappearing.
        Consequently, the bull was torn asunder into five parts and appeared at five locations in the Kedar Khand of
        Garhwal region of the Himalayas.[9] After building the Panch Kedar Temples, the Pandavas meditated at Kedarnath
        for salvation, performed yagna (fire sacrifice) and then through the heavenly path called the Mahapanth (also
        called Swargarohini), attained heaven or salvation. The Panch Kedar Temples are constructed in the North-Indian
        Himalayan Temple architecture with the Kedarnath, Tungnath and Madhyamaheshwar temples looking similar.[11]
<br>
        After completing the pilgrimage of Lord Shiva's darshan at the Panch Kedar Temples, it is an unwritten religious
        rite to visit Lord Vishnu at the Badrinath Temple, as a final affirmatory proof by the devotee that he has
        sought blessings of Lord. <br>
        
<br>
        The Mahabharata, which gives the account of the Pandavas and the Kurukshetra War, does not mention any place
        called Kedarnath. One of the earliest references to Kedarnath occurs in the Skanda Purana (c. 7th-8th century),
        which contains a story describing the origin of the Ganges river. The text names Kedara (Kedarnath) as the place
        where Shiva released the holy water from his matted hair.<br>
