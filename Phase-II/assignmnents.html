    <p>Minicoy Island- One of the most prominent places to visit in Lakshadweep, this island is the central hub that
        connects you to its sister islands. It lies on the southwest side of the group of islands and is adorned with
        many attractions. It is known for its white sandy beaches and lighthouse. The 300 feet lighthouse, built by the
        British in 1885, is a prominent landmark. If you visit this island during special festivals, you will be able to
        witness their traditional dance“Lava” and colourful race boats called “Jahadhoni”.


        Kadmat Island- Low population and rich marine life make this island more attractive than other places to visit
        in Lakshadweep. It is a perfect getaway for people who are in search of serenity. The blue lagoon, sun-kissed
        beaches and colourful coral reefs add to the beauty of this island. Kadmat village is the only inhabited hamlet
        on this island and is a popular nesting spot for marine turtles. Local seafood is something to savour and relish
        here. This Lakshadweep beach is also known as Cardamom Island. It is also one of the best places to visit in
        Lakshadweep for water sports and underwater activities.


        Marine Museum- Located in Kavaratti, Marine Museum is one of the most unique places to visit in Lakshadweep. It
        is home to a variety of marine-related artefacts. With an aim to promote marine products and their preservation,
        this place provides a lot of information about marine life. It also houses an aquarium with several rare species
        of fishes and other sea creatures. If you are curious to know about marine creatures, then this is one of the
        best places to visit in Lakshadweep. The tickets are nominally priced at INR 15 only. </p>

        <center>When to visit Lakshadweep</center>
    </h2>
    <p> Lakshadweep enjoys pleasant weather all round the year. Winter (Oct to March) is the best time to visit
        Lakshadweep as the weather is perfect for sightseeing.

        is easy to explore all the places to visit in Lakshadweep.</p>
    <br>Bangaram Atoll- Bangaram Island is famous for its breathtaking sunrise and sunset. Pristine sand beaches, calm
    lagoons and coral reefs are the main attractions here. This Lakshadweep beach glows at night due to the presence of
    algae which emits light at night. This phenomenon is called bioluminescence. Walking on the glowing Bangaram beach
    at night is a surreal experience.<br> 
    Among all the places to visit in Lakshadweep, Bangaram is the only island Lakshadweep where the sale and consumption
     of alcohol are permitted.<br>
